Flixster shows the latest movies currently playing in theaters. The app utilizes the Movie Database API to display images and basic information about these movies to the user.

Time spent: 11 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can **scroll through current movies** from the Movie Database API
* [x] Display a nice default [placeholder graphic](https://guides.codepath.org/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Glide-Library#advanced-usage) for each image during loading
* [x] For each movie displayed, user can see the following details:
* [x] Title, Poster Image, Overview (Portrait mode)
* [x] Title, Backdrop Image, Overview (Landscape mode)
* [x] Allow user to view details of the movie including ratings within a separate activity

## Notes
This is my second project with Java so i encountered a fair amount of syntax errors and I am also new to Android Development so I got stuck a fair amount of times but I felt more in control during this project than doing the first project.

## Open-source libraries used
